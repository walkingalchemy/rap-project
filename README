Rap Lyrics Project

Rap Lyrics is a project started by Sebastian Royer (@sebastian.royer) to recreate and expand on "The Largest Vocabulary in Hip Hop" (http://rappers.mdaniels.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/), an infographic developed by Matt Daniels (www.mdaniels.com).

Below is a list of features by file:

scraper.py is used to scrape RapGenius.com for lyrics by a specific artist and create a corpus of lyrics for the given artist.

bagger.py is used to create a list of unique words in a specific corpus and record their frequency.

analysis.py is used to create a set of descriptive statistical analyses for a given word corpus.

display.py is used to create a page showing an artist's list of words and their word counts as well as descriptive statistics.
